CSCI 2270 Project

  For this project, I plan to create a simple "choose your own adventure" type game. This project will make use of hash tables, linked lists, and arrays to store information. At first, the user will be greeted by a "guide" to introduce them to the game. The user will be presented with a menu with each option performing a different task. One of the options displayed will be of an inventory of items (shown through a hash table). The items listed are important as you go through the journey. I will make use of linked lists by incorporating them as a way to go from one destination to another. The goal of the game is to successfully reach the end and go through all the given obstacles.
