CSCI 2270 Project
SUMMARY:

  For this project, I created a simple "choose your own adventure" style game. This project made use of hash tables and linked lists to store information. At first, the user will be greeted by a "guide" to introduce them to the game. The user will be presented with a menu with each option performing a different task. One of the options displayed will be of an inventory of items (shown through a hash table). The items listed are important as you go through the journey. I made use of linked lists by incorporating them as a way to go from one destination to another. The goal of the game is to successfully reach the end and go through all the given obstacles. 
  
HOW TO RUN:

  Basically, make sure that a project is started in code blocks. There are three files: the header, the main file, and the source file. Also, make sure that all three files are within one directory (folder). You can run this program both in terminal and in code blocks. The first thing you should see is an introduction provided by the game's narrator. If this shows up, then the program is being run successfully. The narrator and the game's guide "Geno and Gene" will guide you through the program.
  
DEPENDENCIES:

  This program does not require any other third-party library. It basically makes use of the libraries and the items we have used previously during the course.
  
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

  I have only tested this program on the Linux operating system. It might work for both Microsoft and Mac, but it hasn't be tested.
  
GROUP:

  None. I worked on this project by myself.
  
CONTRIBUTORS:

  None as of yet.
  
OPEN ISSUES/BUGS:

  There is an issue with activating certain if statements. For example, if you use a certain item in your inventory to get through an obstacle, it may not produce the outcome that it was intended to produce. This is an issue in some parts of the program.
